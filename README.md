SpreadsheetRow
Represents a single row from a sheet.

These are returned from calling GoogleSpreadsheet.getRows and SpreadsheetWorksheet.getRows.

You can treat the row as a normal javascript object. Object keys will be from the header row of your sheet, however the google API mangles the names a bit to make them simpler. It's easiest if you just use all lowercase keys to begin with.

See limitations above for notes about Google's row-based API!

SpreadsheetRow.save( callback )
Saves any changes made to the row's values.

SpreadsheetRow.del( callback )
Deletes the row from the sheet.
